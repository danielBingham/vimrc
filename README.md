# Bing's .vimrc

This is my vimrc. It's based on [Vim as an IDE](https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide).

Keeping it on github to track changes in it and make it easy propagate those
changes among the various environments I use it in.  

To import it to a new machine, run the following from your home directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:danielbingham/vimrc.vim
ln -s ~/vimrc.vim/vimrc .vimrc
```

Feel free to grab anything you like if you're shopping around for tweaks to
your vimrc.  If you haven't already, I highly recommend taking a look at the
[Vim as an IDE](https://github.com/jez/vim-as-an-ide) repo upon which this
vimrc was originally based.
